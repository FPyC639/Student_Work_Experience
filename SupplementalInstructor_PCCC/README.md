# Supplemental Instructor Position for Calculus 1 Students

During my stay at Passaic County Community College I worked as Supplemental Instructor. I built notes for students to use via TexStudio editor, and LaTex.
Overall my time as supplmental instructor I learned more from the students seeing there is a need of more open source technology to faciliate student learning outcomes.
